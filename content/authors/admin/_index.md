I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the [Advanced Controls Research Laboratory](http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Naira Hovakimyan](http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/). Broadly, my research interests lie in the intersection between robotics, control theory, and statistical learning theory, where I focus on safe motion planning for robots under uncertainty.

While at UIUC, I also spent a few summers working outside of academia towards robotics related problems at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://www.facebook.com/careers/life/facebook-reality-labs-turning-ideas-into-realities) in Redmond (2018), [Paracosm](https://paracosm.io/) (a division of [Occipital](https://occipital.com/)) in Gainesville (2017), and [Qualcomm Research](https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/the-community/innovators/qualcomm-research-philadelphia) in Philadelphia (2016).
